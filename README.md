<h1>Eggy Timer ü•ö</h1>
<h2>üß†What I learn in this app:</h2>

<p>In this project, I learned to familiarize myself with the concepts and functionality of React, as it's one of my first projects using this library. Here, I adapted the first EggyTimer I created with vanilla JavaScript.üç¶ </p>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
  This is an app to control the cooking time of different types of eggs, whether soft, medium, hard or extra hard. It has its different times and ringtone at the end. Enjoy a good boiled egg with this easy method! Created with React + Vite and styles/animations with CSS.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
